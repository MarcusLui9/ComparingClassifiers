# Practical Application Assignment 17.1: ComparingClassifiers
The goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) on a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone

## Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the Application Assignment 17.1. This takes a sample jupyter notebook to complete the exercise to analyse UCI Bank Marketing Data Set in [bank-additional-full.csv] file in the data folder of this repository to build a machine learning application that uses classifications to evaluate customers that will accept the Long-term deposit application using features like job, marital status, education, housing and personal loan.

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of the following classifiers namely 
* K Nearest Neighbor
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees and 
* Support Vector Machines

In comparing the models, the training times and accuracy of the models will be recorded. This should provide an indication on the model that will provide predictions to determine which customer will accept the long term deposit bank product via a phone based marketing campaign.

## Business Understanding

The business objective is to identify key features for used car prices based on the dataset provided so that Car Dealers and their Sales Team can use these key features to understand the cars that they need to have in their inventory to increase sales.

For this application, we are using classfication in Machine Learning as we are comparing classsifiers. Classification is a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data. In classification, the model is fully trained using the training data, and then it is evaluated on test data before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data.
